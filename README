@brief Yet another INI parser

## MOTIVATION

I have to confess that I have never had any particular interest in INI files. But I always had interest in GNU/Linux.

The motivation behind this library came from the observation that many system applications in GNU/Linux rely on _INI-like_ files (systemd, pacman, networkmanager, etc.), and for many users who approach GNU/Linux for the first time it can be frustrating not to have a GUI for configuring their system. So, I thought, a general .conf/.ini editor for GNOME _in dconf-style_ had to be done.

One obstacle to a GUI editor was that configuration files often contain commented suggestions on how to write key/values pairs, what the default values are, etc.; and these suggestions can make a clear sense when editing a plain text, but normally disappear when the text is parsed by some application. So, eventually, an editor would have to be able to not loose the comments, and also to recognize among comments a disabled (commented) key or an entire disabled section, and being flexible enough to support the numerous INI dialects (multiline INI files, support for single/double quotes, different delimiter symbols, nesting sections, etc.).

With this in mind I wrote down the first algorithms for doing the job. As I said, it was the project of an INI editor for GNOME... But I love the free software paradise, and as soon as I had a set of functions able to do one single job (i.e., parsing INI files), I thought that it would be nice to release it as an indipendent library.

Here is where **libconfini** comes.

It can be synthetized as a parser smart enough to allow a complete lossless analysis and parsing of many different types of INI files, but _K.I.S.S._ enough to not store any parsed data, but rather dispatch it (well formatted) to a custom listener. It was born for a GUI editor (which per se needs to read _every_ information out of an INI file), but is usable by any other application that needs to read INI files but does not need to read commented INI lines.

Despite highly configurable and flexible, **libconfini** is still a small piece of work. I really don't know if it will be useful to the community. For sure it does the right job for my editor.
