Library Functions Manual {#libconfini}
======================================

# OVERVIEW

**libconfini** is a simple INI parsing library with the ability to read disabled entries (i.e., commented lines). **libconfini** does not store the data read from an INI file, but rather dispatches it, formatted, to a custom listener.

Unfortunately this manual has not been written yet. You can find a partially self-documented sample usage of **libconfini** under `/usr/share/doc/libconfini/examples/`. Or type **man confini.h** for an overview of the API.
